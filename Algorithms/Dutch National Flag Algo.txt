Dutch National Flag Algorithm OR 3-way Partitioning:
At first, the full array is unknown. 
There are three indices – low, mid and high. 
Initially, the value of low = mid = 1 and high = N.

If the ith element is 0 
then swap the element to the low range, 
thus shrinking the unknown range.



Similarly, if the element is 1 
then keep it as it is but shrink the unknown range.


If the element is 2 
then swap it with an element in high range.


Algorithm:

Keep three indices low = 1, mid = 1 and high = N and there are four ranges, 
1 to low (the range containing 0), 
low to mid (the range containing 1), 
mid to high (the range containing unknown elements) and 
high to N (the range containing 2).


Traverse the array from start to end and 
mid is less than high. (Loop counter is i)


If the element is 0 then swap the element with the element at index low 
and update low = low + 1 and mid = mid + 1

If the element is 1 then update mid = mid + 1
If the element is 2 then swap the element 
with the element at index high and update high = high – 1 
and update i = i – 1. As the swapped element is not processed

Print the output array.
